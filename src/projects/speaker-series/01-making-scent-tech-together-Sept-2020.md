### No. 1: Making Scent-tech together
Our first speaker series event. We discussed 4d multisensorial VR, the first ever live "scent-cast" event at AromaJoin's digital scent hackathon, and Jas Brooks speaks about our Scent Sensing Reading Group, where we are learning the basics of digital e-noses and doing basic Arduino projects.

#### Behind the Scenes of Hackaroma, the digital scent hackathon.
CHU BAO TRUNG [AromaJoin](https://aromajoin.com/) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trungchubao/)
We here at Aromajoin organized Hackaroma, an online hackathon where participants had a chance to develop prototypes with Aroma Shooters triggered through the Internet. This talk is a summary of insights about the event from the perspective of an organizer.

Location: Tokyo

#### Scent Sensing: Aroma Discord Reading Group
[JAS BROOKS](jasbrooks.net) (University of Chicago)
Scent Sensing is a text channel and reading group in the Aroma Discord, devoted to learning and discussing how people are trying to make computers smell and how to apply this technology. The talk will cover the reading group’s structure and future goals.

Jas Brooks is a PhD student at the University of Chicago. Their research focuses on the engineering interactive devices that directly modulate our chemical senses (smell & taste).

Location: New Mexico | Chicago

### Follow ups

September 30, 2020
* After our post-talk conversation, we started a new thread on our Discord server to begin to discuss the concept of olfactory privacy and ethics.
* Created a new website (this website), to post more information about our talks for those who cannot attend.
* We are creating an informational page about Discord (to explain how to use it)
* If you are doing a VR project and would be interested to add a survey to understand how scent effects the experience, please contact Dr. Jacki Morie (our super hero mentor [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquelyn_Ford_Morie), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackimorie26/))

We want to build a great community that excels at international collaboration & working across disciplines without jargon or feeling intimidated (for perfumers, technologists, artists, students and community groups).



[Sign up](https://airtable.com/shrKiJES3nlqxHBXx) to present, get on our mailing list, and get an invitation to the Discord server.
We are volunteer run, and still setting up basic infrastructure for meetings and communications.
